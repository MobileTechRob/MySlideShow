This repository contains the source code for an Android app called Picture Slide Show.  
This application allows you to create a list of photos. Each photo is configured to be displayed for a maximum of 10 seconds. 
There is also a fade time which controls how quickly the next image is brought into view (thus creating a overlap effect).
The number of photos you add to the list is unlimited. You can modify the order of the photos once added to the list.
